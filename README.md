# TkInter GUI for Model Viewer

This is a fun mini project that allow you to view the dectection result of your model. Currently it works only uploading images folder, dedection, and display the results.
To see each individual results, click on the image and (for now) there will be some labels, such as object label and confidence value (in percentage).
